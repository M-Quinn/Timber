# Timber
 Timber is a very simple game built in C++ to help me get used to the C++ syntax coming from a C# and Java background.
 This project was made using C++, in a console app made through Visual Studio.

 In the game, you may use the left or right arrow keys to chop as much wood as possible before the time runs out.
 Be careful, an impact with a tree's limb will end the game.
 Hitting the enter key will restart the game.
